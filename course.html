            <h3>April (2023)</h3>
            <p>As first-time participants in the VEX Robotics Competition (VRC), we wanted to design a robot capable of handling specific game tasks effectively. One of the key challenges was developing a mechanism to launch tribals, which led us to explore building a catapult.</p>

            <p>As we advanced in our VEX Robotics Competition (VRC) journey, we decided to incorporate pneumatics into our robot design. The goal was to use pneumatics for our "wings" so this way we can score multiple tribals in a shorter period.</p>

                <h1>Inspirations</h1>
                <p> The demontration on the right is provided by 
                    the channel choikou vex or from Team 68424A. A ratchet mechanism allows for incremental movement in one direction while preventing movement in the opposite direction.
                     This can be particularly useful in applications requiring controlled, one-way movement or locking functions.
                     Choikou Vex is demonstrating a mechanism where a ratchet is integrated into a hanger/elevator component. 
                    As shown in the elevator system, the ratchet is a part of the mechanism that prevents the elevator from falling if the primary drive system is turned off. 
                    It could also be used for fine adjustment of the elevator’s position. This is crucial because in VRC VEX competitions, robots are to be deactivated and without the ratchet in place, 
                    the robot will fall down when it tries to hang. </p>

                          <h3> One-Way Movement Mechanism </h3>
                          <span style="font-weight:bold;"> 1. Structure and Components</span> 
                            
                          <p>  <span style="font-weight:bold;">   Ratchet Wheel (Gear): </span>This is a circular component with a series of evenly spaced, sloped teeth around its circumference. 
                            These teeth are usually designed with a specific angle, which facilitates movement in one direction.<br>
                            <span style="font-weight:bold;"> Pawl: </span> The pawl is a small lever or catch that pivots or slides to engage with 
                            the teeth of the ratchet wheel. It is typically spring-loaded to ensure it stays in contact with the teeth.</p>

                        <span style="font-weight:bold;"> 2. How One-Way Movement is Achieved</span>

                        <p>  <span style="font-weight:bold;">  Forward Movement:</span>
                        When the ratchet wheel is turned in the allowed direction (the direction that aligns with the pawl's design), the pawl moves smoothly over the teeth of the wheel.
                        The teeth are designed with a slope or angled profile that permits the pawl to glide over them as the wheel turns. This movement is usually facilitated by the pawl’s ability to pivot or slide, reducing friction and allowing smooth rotation.
                        As the wheel turns, the pawl is pushed against the tooth face, which locks it into place relative to the wheel, allowing the wheel to turn freely in this direction.<br>

                       <span style="font-weight:bold;">  Backward Movement:</span>
                        When an attempt is made to turn the wheel in the opposite direction, the pawl catches on the teeth of the ratchet wheel.
                        The teeth are shaped such that they form a barrier or a "stop" against backward movement. The pawl cannot slide or pivot easily against the teeth in this direction because of the shape of the teeth and the angle of the pawl.
                        This prevents the ratchet wheel from rotating in the undesired direction, effectively locking it in place. The mechanism resists movement in the reverse direction due to the interaction between the pawl and the tooth 
                       <br><span style="font-weight:bold;">In summary</span>, the one-way movement in a ratchet mechanism is achieved through a combination of angled teeth on the ratchet wheel and the pawl's design, which allows smooth movement in one direction while preventing any movement in the opposite direction.
                        This design ensures that the mechanism can reliably control and maintain movement or position as needed.
